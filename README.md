# Multiple file renamer script
This script solves the messy file problem (like photos or documents) by giving them clean numerical names (01, 02, 03...) without changing their original folder locations. Perfect when you need to quickly organize hundreds of files, as it creates a neatly numbered copy while preserving your originals. A lifesaver for photographers, designers, or anyone working with multiple files across different folders.
